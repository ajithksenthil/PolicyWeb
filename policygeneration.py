# This code will generate potential policy suggestions using the OpenAI API based on the user need and its effect. You can customize the number of suggestions by changing the n_suggestions parameter. To integrate this into your chatbot application, you can include the generate_policy_suggestions function in your Flask app and create an API endpoint for policy generation.
