# Government Policy Chatbot

This project aims to develop a large-scale app that serves as an interface for users to engage with the government and influence policy. The application enables users to discuss their concerns and worries related to their overall well-being, provides policy suggestions based on user needs, and predicts the impact of policy changes on user needs.

# Features

Chatbot Interface: Allows users to discuss their concerns and worries related to their overall well-being.
Policy Generation and Analysis: Extracts potential policy suggestions from chat transcripts and survey results, predicts and analyzes the impacts of policy changes on user needs, and displays visualizations of the predicted impacts.
User Needs and Survey Response Prediction: Processes chat transcripts to predict user needs and survey responses.
User Feedback and Transparent Policy Display: Implements a feedback submission system for users to provide input on potential policies, ranks and sorts policies based on user feedback, and displays potential policies and user feedback transparently.
# Requirements

Python 3.7 or higher
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
Flask or Django
SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL
OpenAI API (GPT-based language model)
SpaCy or NLTK
# Implementation Steps

Set up the development environment and install the required libraries.
Implement the chatbot interface for users to discuss their concerns and worries related to their overall well-being, and set up user authentication and profile management to store user information and chat transcripts.
Implement NLP-based policy generation to extract potential policy suggestions from chat transcripts and survey results.
Develop a system to predict and analyze the impacts of policy changes on user needs, and create visualizations to display the predicted impacts of policy changes.
Process chat transcripts to extract relevant features for user needs and survey response prediction, train and evaluate machine learning models to predict user needs and survey responses, and incorporate the predictions into the chatbot.
Implement a feedback submission system for users to provide input on potential policies, develop a system to rank and sort policies based on user feedback, and design a frontend UI to display potential policies and user feedback.
Test individual components for functionality and edge cases, and perform end-to-end testing for interoperability between components.
Deploy the app on a web server and set up a database for production use.
# Getting Started

# To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal or command prompt.
Set up your preferred database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL) and configure the application to use the database.
Obtain an API key for the OpenAI API (GPT-based language model) and configure the application to use the API key.
Run the application using your preferred web framework (Flask or Django) and access the app through your web browser.
