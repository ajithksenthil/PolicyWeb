# A. Objective: Develop code to predict and analyze the impacts on user needs given policy changes.

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error


# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("policy_changes_impacts.csv")

# Assume that columns 'feature_1', 'feature_2', ..., 'feature_n' represent policy change features
# and 'impact' represents the impact on user needs
X = data[['feature_1', 'feature_2', ..., 'feature_n']]
y = data['impact']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Scale the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)


# Train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the impact of policy changes on user needs for the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model performance
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

def predict_policy_impact(policy_features):
    # Preprocess the policy features
    policy_features = scaler.transform(policy_features)

    # Predict the impact
    impact = model.predict(policy_features)

    return impact

# Example usage
new_policy_features = np.array([[1.2, 3.4, ..., 5.6]])
predicted_impact = predict_policy_impact(new_policy_features)
print(f"Predicted Impact: {predicted_impact[0]}")

# This example demonstrates how to load and preprocess a dataset, train a regression model, evaluate its performance, and predict the impact of a new policy change. Note that this example assumes the availability of a suitable dataset containing historical policy changes and their corresponding impacts on user needs. The model used here is a simple linear regression model, but other more sophisticated models can be used depending on the nature of the data.



# Descriptive Analysis: Analyze the data to find trends, patterns, and summaries of the users' needs and concerns. This can help identify the most common needs and their effect on people's well-being.
# implementation of descriptive analysis
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("user_needs.csv")

# Plot the distribution of user needs
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.countplot(data=data, x="user_need")
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.title("Distribution of User Needs")
plt.show()


# Geographic Analysis: Assess the needs and effects on a geographical basis, identifying specific regions or areas with higher needs or more significant impacts. This can help in targeting resources and policy changes more effectively.
# Demographic Analysis: Analyze the data by various demographic factors such as age, gender, income, and ethnicity to understand how different groups are affected by policies and their specific needs.
# Time Series Analysis: Analyze the data over time to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and changes in user needs and the impact of policies. This can help evaluate the effectiveness of policy changes and predict future needs.
# Correlation and Causal Analysis: Investigate relationships between variables, such as the relationship between a specific policy change and its impact on users' needs. This can help identify potential causal links and inform decision-making for new policies.
# Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the text data from chat transcripts to understand the overall sentiment of users regarding specific policies, needs, or concerns. This can provide insights into public opinion and highlight areas that require attention.
# Topic Modeling: Apply natural language processing techniques to extract the main topics and themes discussed in the chat transcripts. This can help identify emerging issues and trends in users' needs and concerns.
# Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning algorithms to predict future needs, concerns, and policy impacts based on the collected data. This can help inform proactive policy-making and resource allocation.
