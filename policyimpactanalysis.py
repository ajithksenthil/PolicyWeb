# A. Objective: Develop code to predict and analyze the impacts on user needs given policy changes.
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error


# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("policy_changes_impacts.csv")

# Assume that columns 'feature_1', 'feature_2', ..., 'feature_n' represent policy change features
# and 'impact' represents the impact on user needs
X = data[['feature_1', 'feature_2', ..., 'feature_n']]
y = data['impact']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Scale the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)


# Train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the impact of policy changes on user needs for the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model performance
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

def predict_policy_impact(policy_features):
    # Preprocess the policy features
    policy_features = scaler.transform(policy_features)

    # Predict the impact
    impact = model.predict(policy_features)

    return impact

# Example usage
new_policy_features = np.array([[1.2, 3.4, ..., 5.6]])
predicted_impact = predict_policy_impact(new_policy_features)
print(f"Predicted Impact: {predicted_impact[0]}")

# This example demonstrates how to load and preprocess a dataset, train a regression model, evaluate its performance, and predict the impact of a new policy change. Note that this example assumes the availability of a suitable dataset containing historical policy changes and their corresponding impacts on user needs. The model used here is a simple linear regression model, but other more sophisticated models can be used depending on the nature of the data.




# B. Objective: Develop a chatbot interface for AI representative to communicate with US citizens and understand their needs and concerns related to overall wellbeing, and generate a survey based on the conversation.
